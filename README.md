### Summary
I found this project to be a nice change of pace; I had already learned the material beforehand thanks to university courses and thus this was a fun little refresher to solidify the concepts in my head

### Notes 
- To show output of the driver script, I redirected output to a results.txt file using node tree.mjs > results.txt
- Some Tree methods such as depth(node) and height(node) use helper functions that align with how I understand those concepts
